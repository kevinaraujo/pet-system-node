# Pet Adoption System

System based on nodeJS (express) with Typescript and sqlite to store data. In this system I used repository architecture to separate the reposible from controller layer.

## Getting Started

Run `npm install` on root folder to install the depedencies. After that run `npm start` to start the node server.
